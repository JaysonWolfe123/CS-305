It is important to code securely in order to prevent data theft and lose consumer trust. Consumers are trusting companies with their financial information so if any kind of cyber attack or threat that is sucessful in taking any data will lower the consumers trust in the company to keep the information secure. It can end up losing other deals and partnerships that can occur later because of the lack of security if it does happen. This is why this is a very important to code securely in order to prevent this from ever happening. It is not the end of the world if it does happen but things will have to change, an upgrade in security after any kind of attack will help prevent it from happening again.
